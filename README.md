## What Algorithm should I use?

dynamic programming

## What was the key point and the hard part?

The number should take one of the left upper side or right upper side.
It means that keep taking the maximum value of those two will be the correct answer.
After that , the added numbers will be at the bottom of the triangle, then select the largest one.

## Where can I get more help, if I need it?

You can contact me through email, which is 21500749@handong.edu.
